Q3. Explain any four pseudo classes in CSS with suitable example
ANS: 

Pseudo-classes in CSS are used to define the special state of an element. Here are four commonly used pseudo-classes along with examples:

1. :hover:- This pseudo-class is used to apply styles when the user hovers over an element with their cursor.
example
a:hover {
    color: red;
    text-decoration: underline;
}

In this example, when the user hovers over a link (<a> element), the color of the text changes to red and the text gets underlined.

2. :active:- This pseudo-class applies styles to an element while it is being activated by the user. For example, when a user clicks on a link.
Example:
a:active {
    color: blue;
}

In this example, when the user clicks on a link (<a> element), the color of the text changes to blue.

3. :nth-child():- This pseudo-class allows you to select elements based on their position within a parent element. You can specify a formula to target elements by their position.
Example:
li:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: lightgray;
}

In this example, every even-numbered <li> element within its parent will have a light gray background color.

4. :first-child:- This pseudo-class selects the first child element of its parent.
Example:
ul li:first-child {
    font-weight: bold;
}

In this example, the first <li> element within each <ul> will have bold font weight.
