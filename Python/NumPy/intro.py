*** What is NumPy ***
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

*** Why Use NumPy ***
In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

# Numpy Demo 
# import numpy
# arr = numpy.array([1,2,3,4,5])
# print(arr)

# Now the NumPy package can be referred to as np instead of numpy
# import numpy as np
# print("Numpy version.....")
# print(np.__version__)

# arr = np.array([1,2,3,4])
# print(arr)
